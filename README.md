''' What the Project Is/Does

This is a web-based To-Do List built entirely with HTML.
It allows users to create and organize tasks in a structured list format that can be viewed in any web browser.

Users can create multiple lists using headings.

Tasks are displayed in an organized, readable layout.

Fully functional in desktop and mobile browsers, including iPhones.

Why I Made This Project

I wanted a simple, free To-Do List that works directly in a browser. Many existing options require downloads, accounts, or subscriptions, so I created a straightforward solution that I can access anywhere.

How I Made This Project

Used HTML to structure the lists and tasks.

Organized tasks using headings, paragraphs, and ordered/unordered lists.

Structured the page so itâ€™s easy to read and navigate on both desktop and mobile.

Struggles:

Finding a free To-Do List that works seamlessly in a web browser across devices.
